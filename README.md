# SimpleBase64App

Hi everyone, 

This is a simple Base64 encoding app, I created it as i was annoyed by trying to encode files from websites, also testing out .NET 4.6 which comes with the functions that can pick up the MIME Type of the file. 

Enjoy and use as much of it as you want.

Let me know where it may need work, still relatively new to C#
